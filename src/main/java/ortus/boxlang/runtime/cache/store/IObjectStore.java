/**
 * The main interface for object storages for a BoxLangCache.
 * This store can be used to store objects in memory or in a persistent storage or whatever you want.
 * A cache provider coordinates user interactions an acts more like a cache service to the underlying
 * cache store.
 *
 * Each object store must adhere to this interface and will receive {@link Key} objects as keys so the
 * object store can decide how to store the objects if in case-sensitive or case-insensitive manner.
 *
 * Each object store will also use the {@link ICacheEntry} to store the data so it's consistent across
 * all cache providers and stores.
 *
 * You can implement your own store to store objects in a different way or create your own
 * cache provider to talk to different Caches as well.
